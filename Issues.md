#### DATA ISSUES
 * Cuba --- cuba data source is currently undergoing maitenance, unsure when will resume.. some small update datasets, that may/may not want to account for...their data goes to Sept 20 2021
 * Algeria --- the API seems to not have updated for a while until very recently. The number of days to calculate 10-day cases may be off. Additionally case numbers are v. low. Be careful. Population estimates are from 2008, long time ago.
 * Afghanistan -- unsure how well supported this dataset will be given the current situation.
